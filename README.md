## Requirements

* macOS 10.11+, Windows 7+ or Linux
* Visual Studio Code v1.28.0+
* [Kite Engine](https://kite.com/)

Use another editor? Check out [Kite’s other editor integrations](https://kite.com/integrations/).


## Installation

### Installing the Kite Engine

The [Kite Engine](https://kite.com/) needs to be installed in order for the package to work properly. The package itself
provides the frontend that interfaces with the Kite Engine, which performs all the code analysis and machine learning 100% locally on your computer (no code is sent to a cloud server).

__macOS Instructions__
1. Download the [installer](https://kite.com/download/) and open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the Kite icon into the `Applications` folder.
3. Run `Kite.app` to start the Kite Engine.

__Windows Instructions__
1. Download the [installer](https://kite.com/download/) and run the downloaded `.exe` file.
2. The installer should run the Kite Engine automatically after installation is complete.

__Linux Instructions__
1. Visit https://kite.com/linux/ to install Kite.
2. The installer should run the Kite Engine automatically after installation is complete.


### Installing the Kite Plugin for Visual Studio Code

When running the Kite Engine for the first time, you'll be guided through a setup process which will allow you to install
the VS Code extension. You can also install or uninstall the VS Code extension at any time using the Kite Engine's [plugin
manager](https://help.kite.com/article/62-managing-editor-plugins).

Alternatively, you have 2 options to manually install the package:
1. Search for "Kite" in VS Code's built-in extension marketplace and install from there.
2. Run the command `code --install-extension kiteco.kite` in your terminal.

## Usage

The following is a brief guide to using Kite in its default configuration.

### Autocompletions

Simply start typing in a saved Python or JavaScript file and Kite will automatically suggest completions for what you're typing. Kite's autocompletions are all labeled with the `⟠` symbol.

![completions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/589ced522c7d3a784630c348/images/5c3eb54f04286304a71e4292/file-jJZznGIq2t.png)

### Hover (Python only)

Hover your mouse cursor over a symbol to view a short summary of what the symbol represents.

### Documentation (Python only)

Click on the `Docs` link in the hover popup to open the documentation for the symbol inside the Copilot, Kite's standalone
reference tool.

### Definitions (Python only)

If a `Def` link is available in the hover popup, clicking on it will jump to the definition of the symbol.

### Function Signatures (Python only)

When you call a function, Kite will show you the arguments required to call it. Kite's function signatures are also all
labeled with the `⟠` symbol.

> __Note:__ If you have the Microsoft Python extension installed, Kite will _not_ be able to show you information on
> function signatures.

### Commands

Kite comes with several commands that you can run from VS Code's command palette.

|Command|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`kite.related-code-from-file`|Search for code related to the current file in the Copilot|
|`kite.related-code-from-line`|Search for code related to the current line in the Copilot|
